# Spark-Using-Python-

--> Here i have Created a Spark Session and worked on the window aggregations for some practise.

--> When it comes to aggreations spark contains three types of aggreations.

1. Window Aggregations
2. Grouping Aggregations
3. Simple Aggregations.

Here i am only working on Window aggregations. 

--> Window aggregation is nothing but here we are dealing with a fixed size window. 
--> It's like a basic function like create a function and call it when required.
--> You can work on rank, dense_rank, row_number fucntions in spark using this window fucntion.

--> window function basically takes two main important things one is partition by and other one is order. i have showed an example in the notebook file.
